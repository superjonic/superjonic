Creative human with many energy capable to achieve and deliver, my channels to fill my spirit are Software Development & Entrepreneurship. The focus is always the same: Build excellents products and experiences looking for adding value, impact and of course have fun.

I am a musician ( guitar player ), entrepreneur, full stack developer (in construction). My passion is to create valuable things for the community, that's the why of my learning.

Superjonic (superjonico in spanish): it's a concept created by me, it's about compose music overlaping differents ionan scales, the tones and sounds as a result are very interesting.
